      Was a helper for the browser that was once extremeley popular. It has
      falled out of favor for other frameworks like React, Bootstrap, and or
      other complex options for building websites. It is still a major part of
      the web and will be encountered in the wild many, many times over.
      JavaScript in the browser without any help or tools is considered vanilla
      JS. The base language of JS.

      Jquery takes the DOM and wraps the DOM into a helper toolset. Takes the
      complexity of the DOM and makes it easier to handle.
